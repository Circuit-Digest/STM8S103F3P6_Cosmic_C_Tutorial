Programming a new microcontroller often takes a longer time due to the new register handling methods and not knowing what bit does exactly what. The same goes for debugging as well without saying. This is why programmers quite often use breakpoints in their code and step through it using a debugger. But using a debugger might need additional hardware (most times expensive) and also additional time. Being an Arduino fan boy, one thing we all can agree is using serial print statements for debugging and understanding our code makes life a lot easier. What is we can replicate the same on STM8s with cosmic C compiler and SPL libraries? Well, it is very much possible, and that is exactly what we are going to do in this third tutorial of our tutorial series. You also check the getting started with STM8S [tutorial 1](https://github.com/Circuit-Digest/STM8S103F3P6_Cosmic_C_Tutorial/tree/master/T1_Getting%20Started_with_the_STM8S) and STM8S GPIO control [tutorial 2](https://github.com/Circuit-Digest/STM8S103F3P6_Cosmic_C_Tutorial/tree/master/T2_Blinking_and_Controlling_LED_with_Push_Button_using_STM8S_Cosmic_C) if you are completely new here. Also, we have also explored the possibility of [Programming STM8S with Arduino](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/programming-stm8s-microcontrollers-using-arduino-ide) for quick starters. All that being said letâ€™s get into the tutorial.
