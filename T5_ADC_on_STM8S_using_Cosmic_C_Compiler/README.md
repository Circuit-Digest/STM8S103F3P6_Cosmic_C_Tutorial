In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the ADC feature on our STM8S103F3P6 Microcontroller. As we know “We live in an analog world with digital devices”, meaning everything around us like wind speed, light intensity, temperature, and everything we deal with like speed, velocity, pressure, etc. are analog in nature. But our microcontrollers and microprocessors are digital devices and they will not be able to measure these parameters without an important peripheral called [Analog to Digital Converters (ADC)](https://circuitdigest.com/tags/adc). So in this article, let's learn how to use ADC on STM8S Microcontroller with COMIC C compiler.

If you are new to STM8, do check out the [Getting Started with STM8S using STVD and Cosmic C Compiler](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/getting-started-with-stm8s-using-stvd-and-cosmic-c-compiler) article to understand the basics of the controller board and programming environment. We will not be covering the basics in this tutorial.
