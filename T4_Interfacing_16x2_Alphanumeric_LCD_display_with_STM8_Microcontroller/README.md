The 16x2 Alphanumeric LCD display is the most commonly used display among hobbyists and enthusiasts. The display is very useful when you want to display basic information to the user and can also help in testing or debugging our code. This particular 16x2 LCD module is easily available and has been popular for a long time. You can learn more about the basics of the 16x2 LCD module in the linked article.

To continue with our series of STM8 Microcontroller tutorials, in this tutorial, we will learn how to interface a LCD with STM8 Microcontroller. 
If you are new to STM8, do check out the [Getting Started with STM8S using STVD and Cosmic C Compiler](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/getting-started-with-stm8s-using-stvd-and-cosmic-c-compiler) article to understand the basics of the controller board and programming environment. We will not be covering the basics in this tutorial.
