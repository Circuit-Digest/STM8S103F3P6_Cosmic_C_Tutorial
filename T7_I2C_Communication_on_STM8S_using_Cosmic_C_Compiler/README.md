In this article, we are going to perform the I2C Communication on STM8S microcontroller by using the MLX90614 I2C sensor. We will measure the Ambient Temperature and the Object’s Temperature and then we will display the measured temperature on the LCD. If you are following the STM8S Microcontroller Tutorials, you would know that we have already covered the basics of the STM8s using the Cosmic C Compiler.

If you are new to STM8, do check out the [Getting Started with STM8S using STVD and Cosmic C Compiler](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/getting-started-with-stm8s-using-stvd-and-cosmic-c-compiler) article to understand the basics of the controller board and programming environment. We will not be covering the basics in this tutorial.
