In this tutorial, we will learn about the implementation of the Serial Parallel Interface (SPI) Communication on the STM8S103F3P6 board using an 8x8 Led matrix display module as the SPI device. There are 4 GPIO pins that we will be using to perform the SPI communication. So, let’s see what components will be required to perform the SPI communication on STM8S board. You can check our tutorials on the STM8S Microcontroller where we have discussed on How to setup the Cosmic C compiler and we have covered the PWM, ADC, UART and I2C with the STM8S103F3P6 development board. 


If you are new to STM8, do check out the [Getting Started with STM8S using STVD and Cosmic C Compiler](https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/getting-started-with-stm8s-using-stvd-and-cosmic-c-compiler) article to understand the basics of the controller board and programming environment. We will not be covering the basics in this tutorial.
